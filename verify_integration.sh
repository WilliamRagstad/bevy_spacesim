echo "Key Benefits Achieved:"
echo "- Arbitrary floating point precision maintained regardless of position"
echo "- Adaptive origin system follows spaceship automatically"
echo "- Maximum detail level preserved for all entities at any distance"
echo "- No precision loss when moving far from origin (e.g. 1M+ units)"
echo "- Floating origin recenters coordinate system automatically"
